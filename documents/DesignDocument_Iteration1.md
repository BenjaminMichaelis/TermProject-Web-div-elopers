## 1. Introduction

This design document is provided to describe the design of the
WSU EECS Undergraduate Research Website. Doing so will allow
development to proceed with a clear understanding of what is
going to be built and how it is expected to be build.

Then provide a brief description of your project and state your project goal.

The Project for which this document is for is the WSU EECS Undergraduate
Research Website. The goal is to create a website that will connect
students to faculty members who need undergraduate researchers.
Faculty will be able to post research opportunities, and students will
be able to look for and apply to posted positions.

Section II will include architectural details about the project.

Section III will include a Progress report for this iteration
(iteration 1).

## 2. Architectural and Component-level Design

### 2.1 System Structure

This section should describe the high-level architecture of your software:  i.e., the major subsystems and how they fit together.
If you adopted the application structure we used in the Smile App, your application would have the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. If you adopted a different architectural pattern, mention the pattern you adopted in your software and briefly discuss the rationale for using the proposed architecture (i.e., why that pattern fits well for your system).

In this section:

* Provide a UML component diagram that illustrates the architecture of your software.
* Briefly explain the role of each subsystem in your architectural design and explain the dependencies between them.
* Discuss the rationale for the proposed decomposition in terms of cohesion and coupling.

![UMLDiagram](images/UMLDiagram.png)

The View subsystem includes any visual representation of information to the user.
The Model subsystem includes any logic that manages the data of the system.
The Controller subsystem accepts input and interprets it in to commands for the
Model or View subsystem.

The View Model Controller framework was chosen because of its tendency to have
high Cohesion, due to the logic being separated into View, Model, and Controller
components. Much of the logic in each component dealt with a specific category
of tasks for the app. This framework also promotes high coupling by making sure
the View, Model, and Controller components only interact in specific ways.

### 2.2 Subsystem Design

(Note: This is just a suggested template. If you adopted a pattern other than MVC, you should revise this template and the list the major subsystems in your architectural design.)

#### 2.2.1 Model

Briefly explain the role of the model.  

The role of the model is to manage the data, logic, and rules of the application. In other words,
it contains only pure application data. It does not handle any logic on how to present the data
to the user.

(***in iteration-1***) Include a list of the tables (models) in your database and explain the role of each table. Provide the attributes of the tables and briefly explain each attribute.

##### List of tables

* Post Table:

|  | Field name     | Description   | Field type  | Constraints | Comments |
|---|---------------|--------------|------------|------------|---------|
|1. |     id         | autogenerated id |  Integer | primary key | |
|2. |    title       | post title          | String | max 150 characters | |
|4. | description    | post text           | String | max 1500 characters | |
|5. |   startdate    | date posting begins | Date   | | |
|6. |  enddate       | date posting ends | Date | | |
|7. | timecommitment | how many hours a week | Integer | | |
|8. | qualifications | expected qualifications from applicants | String | max 1500 characters | |
|9. |  user_id       | id of who posted it | Integer | | |
|10.|  timestamp     | What time post was created | DateTime | Default is current utc time |

* Field Table:

|   | Field name     | Description   | Field type  | Constraints | Comments |
|:--|:---------------|:--------------|:------------|:------------|:---------|
|1. |     id         | autogenerated id |  Integer | primary key        |         |
|2. |   name       | name of the field         | String | max 20 characters    |         |

* User Table:

|   | Field name     | Description   | Field type  | Constraints | Comments |
|:--|:---------------|:--------------|:------------|:------------|:---------|
|1. |     id         | autogenerated id |  Integer | primary key             |              |
|2. |   username     | login name for user| String | max 64 characters             |              |
|4. |     email      | email address      | String | max 120 characters, unique     | |
|5. | password_hash  | password stored as a hash | String | max 128 characters | |
|6. |    posts       | date posting ends | Date |  | backref writer, lazy = dynamic  |
|7. |   faculty      | Whether this user is faculty | Boolean | default is False |           |
|8. |    admin       | Whether this user is an admin | Boolean | default is False |           |

(***in iteration -2***) Revise the database model. Provide a UML diagram of your database model showing the associations and relationships among tables. Your UML diagram should also show the methods of your models.

#### 2.2.2 Controller

The controller exists as a layer between the view and the model. It takes events from the
view, triggered by user actions, and calls the correct logic for each event. Usually this
will involve calling a method on the model.

##### Controller Subsystems

1. Authorization Forms \
   The authorization forms subsystem handles the creation of forms
   for logging in and registering users. It interacts with the model
   subsystem by looking up users, for the purpose of making sure the
   input email and username is unique.

2. Authorization Routes \
   The authorization routes subsystem handles the logic for logging in
   and registering users. It interacts with the model by adding users
   to the data base when registering a user, and checking user login
   credentials when logging in a user. It also interacts with the controller
   component by getting the user input from LoginForm and registration form

3. Errors \
   Handles either 404 or 500 errors. Interacts with the models subsystem
   by rolling back the database when a 500 error is thrown.

4. Forms \
   The forms subsystem handles the creation of forms for posting forms,
   and eventually forms for other features. It has no dependencies.

5. Routes \
   The routes subsystem handles the logic for adding a new post to
   the app. It interacts with the Model component by using the post
   model to create new posts.

**Note:** Some of your subsystems will interact with the Web clients (browsers). Make sure to include a detailed description of the  Web API interface (i.e. the set of routes) your application will implement. For each route specify its “methods”, “URL path”, and “a description of the operation it implements”.  
You can use the following table template to list your route specifications.

(***in iteration-1***) Brainstorm with your team members and identify all routes you need to implement for the completed application and explain each route briefly. If you included most of the major routes but you missed only a few, it maybe still acceptable.

|   | Methods           | URL Path   | Description  |
|:--|:------------------|:-----------|:-------------|
|1. |  Get, Post        | /register/ | To registering new users |
|2. |  Get, Post        | /login/    | Logging in preexisting users |
|3. |  Get              | /logout/   | Log out the current user |
|4. |  Get, Post        | /index/    | Homepage of the site |
|5. |  Get, Post        | /post/     | For faculty to add a new post to the site  |

#### 2.2.3 View and User Interface Design

The role of the view component is to handle how to present the application to the user.
It can access the data in the model, but it does not deal not interpret or manipulate this
data. We intend on using the bootstrap library to handle most of the design aspects of the app.

In the registration form we have a user register for an account with valid information (such as a wsu email), and after filling this out without errors, they can login and get forwarded to their edit profile page. This is for Use-Case Create Account as a user without an account

![Registration Form](images/RegistrationPage.jpg)

From the faculty permissions, you have a button to make a new post which sends you to the make a new post page, where you fill out the details and submit the form. This is for Use-Case Create Research Position.

![Post Form](images/PostResearchPosition.jpg)

Then from the student page you can view all available posts. This is for Use-Case View open research positions.

![Student Post View](images/StudentViewPosts.jpg)

To view profile information a user can click on view profile button and then the edit profile button to add additional information. This is for use-cases view and edit user profile/add profile information.

![Display User Profile](images/DisplayUserProfile.jpg)
![Edit User Profile](images/EditUserProfile.jpg)

To log-in, the user when logged out is automatically redirected to the login screen. This is for use-case log in as a user.

## 3. Progress Report

In this iteration, we focused on adding the basic features for the app. Users can now create
accounts, as well as login and log out. Users can also edit the information on their profiles
For the faculty users, the ability to post research positions was also added. Faculty users can create a research position, and all users can view open research positions.
